# Nairobi-Hospital-Hypothyroidism-Prediction
Moringa Data Science Core W8 Independent Project

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This week we learnt about Machine Learning. specifically:Decesion Trees, Random Forests and SVM models.
I will be putting what I learnt to test with this dataset about hyopthroidism and hyperthroidism

I intend to find out whether we can use the independent variables to come up with an accurate price for the houses.

I think I succesfuly created models and tested their accuracy succesfuly. However there is always room for improvement.

My best model scored an accuracy score of 98.5%.

A suggested point of improvement would be to get an accuracy score for the Random forest model created with gridsearch. This will help with comparison of the models. 
Another suggestion is to increase visualizations diagrams for each model


### Built With

Here are the major tools that we used for the data analysis

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Tableu Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://github.com/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I did this analysis with the intention of improving my skills in machine learning. However, the models used in this analysis could be used by doctors and patients alike to
improve diagnosis of diseases. At the moment, the model is tuned to predict hypothyroidism with an impressive accuracy. however, it can be easily be edited to work with other
disease diagnosis

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Following my analysis I identified some gaps in the data and would like to continue improving the dashboard and analysis in order to come up with a more accurate prediction on footbal game results
.
Some of the data that would have been nice to have are:

1. Better structured datasets. I had a particularly hard time fitting the models to the dataset

### On a side note

Similar datasets for different diseases will be great for diagnosis of different diseases
